Second Project for UNCC Coding Bootcamp: Bare Bones Budget

## Description
This application provides a budget breakdown for a user based on their entered monthly income and expenses. The user is able to edit income and expenses as necessary, and track how much they are (or aren't) saving toward a goal. They are also able to see a breakdown of their expenses via the six categories provided.

## Functionality
A new or returning user is provided with the option to sign in or create a new account on the homepage. Once the user is authenticated and signed in they are brought to a snapshot of their overall budget, or provided with the ability to enter their budget information for the first time. There are six categories for expense information to be entered into: travel, food, transportation, services, health and miscellaneous. The user is able to navigate to these categories separately via six button links on the snapshot page, and a further breakdown of expenses within that category are provided. They are also able to add and delete information to that category while within it to update their budget.

User information is stored and dynamically updated within a database, and that information is pulled from and displayed on the website upon inquiry. A pie chart is displayed on the snapshot page with expense information,and a breakdown list and bar graph are displayed on each category page.
